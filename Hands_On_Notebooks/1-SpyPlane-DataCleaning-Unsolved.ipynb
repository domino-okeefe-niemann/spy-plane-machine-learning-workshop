    "#### Background\n",
    "This data comes from a news [article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/hidden-spy-planes) that used machine learning to identify potential spy aircraft over the continental United States. The data is available in this [Github repository](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2017-08-spy-plane-finder) and the code in this notebook is based on details found [here](https://buzzfeednews.github.io/2017-08-spy-plane-finder/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data \n",
    "BuzzFeed News obtained more than four months of aircraft transponder detections from the plane tracking website Flightradar24, covering August 17 to December 31, 2015 UTC, containing all data displayed on the site within a bounding box encompassing the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flightradar24 receives data from its network of ground-based receivers, supplemented by a feed from ground radars provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with a five-minute delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create this dataset, Buzzfeed filtered the data to remove planes registered abroad, based on their adshex code, common commercial airliners, based on their type, and aircraft with fewer than 500 transponder detections.\n",
    "\n",
    "They then took a random sample of 500 aircraft and calculated the following for each one:\n",
    " \n",
    "- `duration` of each flight segment recorded by Flightradar24, in minutes.\n",
    "- `boxes` Area of a rectangular bounding box drawn around each flight segment, in square kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following describes each of the columns in the dataset for the remaining 19,799 aircraft:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `adshex` Unique identifier for each aircraft, corresponding to its “Mode-S” code, in hexademical format.\n",
    "- `duration1`,`duration2`,`duration3`,`duration4`,`duration5` Proportion of flight segment durations for each plane falling into each of five quantiles calculated from duration for the sample of 500 planes. The proportions for each aircraft must add up to 1; if the durations of flight segments for a plane closely matched those for a typical plane from the sample, these numbers would all approximate to 0.2; a plane that mostly flew very long flights would have large decimal fraction for duration5.\n",
    "- `boxes1`,`boxes2`,`boxes3`,`boxes4`,`boxes5` Proportion of bounding box areas for each plane falling into each of five quantiles calculated from boxes for the sample of 500 planes.\n",
    "- `speed1`,`speed2`,`speed3`,`speed4`,`speed5` Proportion of speed values recorded for the aircraft falling into each of five quantiles recorded for speed for the sample of 500 planes.\n",
    "- `altitude1`,`altitude2`,`altitude3`,`altitude4`,`altitude5` Proportion of altitude values recorded for the aircraft falling into each of five quantiles recorded for altitude for the sample of 500 planes.\n",
    "- `steer1`,`steer2`,`steer3`,`steer4`,`steer5`,`steer6`,`steer7`,`steer8` Steer was calculated as the change in compass bearing from the previous transponder detection for that aircraft; negative values indicate a turn to the left, positive values a turn to the right. These values represent the proportion of steer values for each aircraft falling into bins set manually, after observing the distribution for the sample of 500 planes, using the breaks: -180, -25, -10, -1, 0, 1, 22, 45, 180.\n",
    "- `flights` Total number of flight segments for each plane.\n",
    "- `squawk_1` Squawk code used most commonly by the aircraft.\n",
    "- `observations` Total number of transponder detections for each plane.\n",
    "- `type` Aircraft manufacter and model, if identified, else unknown."
