## Background
This notebook contains materials for the Introduction to Machine Learning workshop. 

This data comes from a news [article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/hidden-spy-planes) that used machine learning 
to identify potential spy aircraft over the continental United States. 
The data is available in this [Github repository](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2017-08-spy-plane-finder) and on 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/spy-plane-finder)
and the code in this notebook is based on details found [here](https://buzzfeednews.github.io/2017-08-spy-plane-finder/).

## Contents
The Demo-Notebooks folder contains the exercises for the Python overview,
linear regression example, and logistic regression example. 

The Spy-Plane-Project folder contains the following interactive activities:
* 1-SpyPlane-DataCleaning-Unsolved.ipynb
* 2-SpyPlane-RandomForestClassifier-Unsolved.ipynb
* 2-SpyPlane-RandomForestClassifier-Unsolved.ipynb

* Solved folder - contains solutions for each Unsolved notebook.

The Model-Comparison folder contains scripts to evaluate precision and recall for various
models using the domino stats features in the Jobs overview page.

The Intro-to-ML-Reference.pdf is a reference guide to many of the functions
needed for the intractive exercises. 

The Overview of Machine Learning.pdf contains the slides for the lecture portion 
of the workshop.
